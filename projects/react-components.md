## Usage

### Importing Components

You can import components individually for better tree-shaking:

```javascript
import DatePicker from "react-components-collection/dist/DatePicker";
```

Alternatively, you can import multiple components from the main entry point:

```javascript
import { DatePicker, ColorPicker } from "react-components-collection";
```


### Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the **DatePicker** component:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import DatePicker from "react-components-collection/dist/DatePicker";

function App() {
  const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState(null);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Select a Date</h1>
      <DatePicker
        value={selectedDate}
        onChange={(date) => setSelectedDate(date)}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
